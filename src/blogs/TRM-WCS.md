## After Thoughts
The characters in this book were AMAZING!!! Liz Tomforde did not disappoint. A friend of mine told me to read this book while I was at the beach, but I held off until the trip back….lordy, I should have read it sooner (shout out to Raenah Barton). Before I read this book I did not read Mile High about Zanders and Stevie, and now I wish I did. 

From the beginning of the book I was invested, they were so cute together even though they were “fake dating”, I think that just helped their bond even more when they decided to finally love each other openly. I enjoyed the use of third-act breakup because it helped the character come back to each other every time a miscommunication occurred. Mainly Ryan kept misinterpreting Indy’s emotions (come on man she mentioned multiple times she was an EMOTIONAL WOMAN). We love a woman who is not afraid to show her emotions and a man who is too afraid to love freely!!!! Anyway, this book received 5/5 stars from me on my romance scale….Love INDY and RYAN. This book also brought the spice!!!

 Could be considered a slow burn, but I'm not sure. Once they were fully committed to loving each other they let the clothes fly, and I LOVED IT!! On my spicy scale 4.2/5. (Need to read more to update my level of spicy scale ;)).
